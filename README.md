# Airbnb Clone Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my Airbnb clone project! In this project, I've created a simplified version of the popular Airbnb platform. Users can browse listings, view property details, and make reservations. As a developer, I've implemented the core features necessary for an Airbnb-like experience.

## Features
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - Passwords are securely hashed and stored.
2. **Property Listings:**
   - Property owners can create listings with details such as title, description, location, price, and amenities.
   - Users can search for properties based on location, dates, and other filters.
3. **Booking System:**
   - Users can view property availability and make reservations.
   - Booking requests are sent to property owners for approval.
4. **Reviews and Ratings:**
   - Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they've stayed in.
   - Property owners can respond to reviews.
5. **Messaging:**
   - Users can communicate with property owners through an in-app messaging system.
6. **Payment Integration:**
   - Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for handling transactions.
